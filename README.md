## Why Vox?

- **Quick to open, light on memory.** It uses your system's built-in web view instead of bundling a whole browser, so it starts fast and stays small.
- **Quick to launch.** Once a game is set up, launching it doesn't re-download or re-check anything.
- **Looks the way you want.** Four themes plus your own, eight layouts, and your own colours.
- **Everything in one place.** Instances, mods, worlds, screenshots, skins and logs, all inside the launcher.

## Features

### Instances
- Vanilla, **Fabric**, **Quilt**, **Forge** and **NeoForge**
- Groups, icons, notes and play time for every instance
- Duplicate, delete, export and import instances (`.zip`)
- Per-instance Java, memory, game window size, launch arguments, and commands that run before and after the game
- **Desktop shortcuts:** one click puts an icon on your desktop or Start menu that opens Vox and starts that instance
- **Quick join:** start an instance straight into a server (or a world, on Minecraft 1.20 and newer), or hit **Join** next to any saved server
- **Snapshots:** save an instance's mods and settings, compare, and roll back if an update breaks something. Worlds are never touched
- **Import from other launchers:** find your instances in **Prism Launcher**, **MultiMC**, the **official Minecraft launcher** and the **CurseForge app**, then bring in all of them or just the ones you pick. Your originals are never touched

### Mods and modpacks
- Search **Modrinth** from inside the launcher
- One-click install. Before anything downloads, Vox shows which other mods it needs (and installs them for you)
- Warnings before you install something that doesn't match your Minecraft version or mod loader, and a way to see every version if you want to try anyway
- **Discover** has filters for Minecraft version, mod loader, category and where a mod runs. Click a title to open its page on Modrinth
- Turn mods on or off, delete them, and check for updates
- **Update all mods** in every instance with one button, with a summary. A snapshot is saved first
- **Mod problem warnings** before launch: duplicate mods, mods made for another loader or Minecraft version, and missing required mods
- Install or import **Modrinth modpacks** (`.mrpack`), and **update an installed modpack in place**: its own files are swapped, while your worlds, settings, disabled mods and extra mods stay
- Resource packs and shader packs get the same treatment

### Worlds, screenshots and servers
- Back up and delete worlds
- Browse and delete screenshots
- Edit your multiplayer server list without starting the game
- Read game logs and crash reports

### Crash helper
When the game stops unexpectedly, Vox reads the crash report and explains in plain English what probably went wrong: out of memory, the wrong Java, a missing mod, a graphics driver problem, a damaged file. Where it can, it offers a button that fixes it.

### Accounts and skins
- Sign in with your Microsoft account, or add an offline profile for singleplayer
- **Skin library:** save skins, switch between them in one click
- **3D preview:** a rotating model of your skin and cape. Drag to turn it, and hover a cape to see it on before you choose it
- Upload a skin, reset it, or change your cape

### Sync your settings
Copy your keybinds and options from your regular `.minecraft` folder (or another instance) into any instance, once or automatically every time you launch.

### Make it yours
- **Themes:** Voxel (the default), Sleek, Bold and Minimal
- **Custom theme editor:** pick your colours, try presets, and export or import a theme as a file
- **Layouts:** Cover, Dense, Glass, Classic, Compact, Right rail, Bottom bar and Zen
- **Downloads page:** speed, pause and cancel for anything running in the background
- **Portable mode:** unzip the portable build anywhere (a USB stick works); everything stays in a `data` folder beside it
- Accent colour, interface size, compact mode and reduced motion
- Console pop-up that shows game output when you launch (optional)
- Desktop notifications when downloads and installs finish
- Discord Rich Presence, with an optional "show the server I'm on" switch

### Stay up to date
Vox checks for new versions when it starts and can install them for you. If you ever want to remove it, there's an **Uninstall** button in Settings that lets you keep or delete your data.

### Vox Client (optional)
A small Fabric mod you can add to any Fabric or Quilt instance with one click: FPS and CPS counters, keystrokes and a zoom key. It's client-side only, and you can remove it just as easily. *(Currently for Minecraft 1.21.4.)*

## Getting started

1. Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/sylphiras/vox-launcher/releases/latest) page and download the Windows installer.
2. Run it. No administrator rights are needed.
3. Open Vox Launcher, choose **New instance**, pick a Minecraft version and a mod loader, and press **Play**.
4. Want mods? Open **Discover** to find them.

To play online, add your Microsoft account under **Accounts**. Offline profiles work for singleplayer and LAN.

## Your data

Everything lives in `%APPDATA%\Vox Launcher\data`. Open it from **Settings → Data and about**. Uninstalling keeps it unless you choose otherwise.

**Portable copy:** download `Vox-Launcher-Portable.zip` from a release and unzip it anywhere. Because the `portable.txt` file sits next to the program, everything is kept in a `data` folder beside it, so you can carry the whole folder on a USB stick. Portable copies don't update themselves; download the new zip instead.

## Privacy

Vox Launcher has no accounts, analytics or tracking, and it sends nothing to its developer. It only talks to the services you use through it: Mojang and Microsoft (game files and sign-in), Modrinth (mods), GitHub (launcher updates and the Vox Client mod) and, if you switch it on, Discord (your status stays on your own PC). Your sign-in token is kept in the Windows credential store, and everything else stays in the data folder on your PC.
